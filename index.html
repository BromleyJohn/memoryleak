<h1>Memory Leak</h1>

A memory leak reduces performance by reducing the amount of available memory. Eventually, in the worst case, too much of the available memory may become allocated and all or part of the person stops working correctly, the mind fails, or slows down vastly.<p>

Memory leaks may not be serious or even detectable by normal means. Normal memory used by a mind is released when the brain terminates. This means that a memory leak that only runs for a short time may not be noticed and is rarely serious.<p>

Much more serious memory leaks occurred to the people caught up in the disturbing times described in the story below :-<p>

<h2>Edward Visits the University</h2>

Edward walked towards the decrepit buildings in the distance. The first few drops of cold rain fell from the dark and brooding sky. The melancholy feelings that had haunted him all day returned with a vengeance. It had been several years since he was last here, during happier times. It was then one of the top universities in the UK. Since then the country had changed and no longer catered for bright young minds with hopes and aspirations. The people now housed in the buildings are what the new regime classed as the lowest of the low. No dreams, no hope, no aspirations, just survival.<p>

An old entrance door flapped in the wind which had picked up considerably during the last five minutes. Edward walked through the door and into a darkened hallway which contained a lift and stairwell. He walked up the stairs to the first floor which consisted of a walkway that formed a complete square with apartments on all four sides to the right. To the left, you could peer over a low wall to the quadrangle of scarred and muddied grass below.<p>

There were people sitting outside many of the apartments. They were of various ages and all appeared to be of the same Eastern European origin. Many of them had musical instruments, familiar acoustic guitars but also some unusual stringed instruments. A young girl had a toy plastic organ that she was playing with great dexterity. They were singing a slow haunting folk song that mixed with the now howling wind. A mournful church bell, caught by the wind, could be heard tolling in the distance.<p>

"What do you want?", asked one of the older men, addressing Edward with a cold expression. The music gradually faded to a complete halt leaving just the sound of the wind & the bell. "Nothing, I just wondered what was up here", said Edward lying. "I heard the music", he added as an afterthought. The man turned away from Edward saying "You want nothing? We have plenty of that. Take as much as you want!"<p>

<h2>Edward In the Quadrangle</h2>

Edward turned slowly and walked back past the broken down lift. He went down the cold dank stairs that he had come up earlier and into the quadrangle that he had viewed from the walkway above. He could see that some of the people he had come across before were now peering down at him with inquisitive (and sometimes hostile) looks.<p>

The grass looked in an even worse state now that he was closer to it. It appeared to have a secondary use as an impromptu football pitch and two areas were considerably more worn where the goal areas would have been located. An old white Transit van was stationed in the far corner with the bonnet up. One man was sitting in the driver's seat constantly turning over the engine to no avail while another peered into the engine compartment, they were oblivious to Eugene.<p>

There were apartments situated around the quadrangle in the same layout as the floor above, but these did not seem to be occupied. Many had their front doors wide open and were full of rubbish. Some appeared to be in use as makeshift workshops containing old tools and machinery.<p>

Music was coming from one of the apartments. It was not like the folk song Edward had heard previously. This was girls singing over a heavy electronic sequenced beat. It sounded like the dance music he used to hear in clubs some years ago but with its own distinctive slant. The door was open, so he went in. Two young girls were singing through an old PA system. They were surrounded by old keyboards from decades gone by. Eugene recognised cheap ‘Casios’ and other brands that could have been picked up off eBay (when it existed) for a few pounds. The keyboards had all been ingeniously linked to an old laptop that acted as the sequencer brain of the system and ‘played’ the keyboards, some of which were just propped up against the walls.<p>

One of the girls hit the space bar on the laptop and the music abruptly stopped. All that could now be heard was the buzzing of the ancient PA system. “What do you want?” asked one of the girls. She was in her late teens with long dark hair. Her friend, a blond headed girl of around the same age looked at Eugene with inquisitive eyes. Edward smiled to himself recognising this was the second time he has been asked the same question in the space of a few minutes.<p>

“I just wanted to see where the great music was coming from,” said Edward.<p>

“Oh, thanks,” said the blonde girl who spoke perfect English with a slight accent. “But what are you doing here?” she added.
I wish I knew, thought Edward. The girl continued. "Go and see Casper, three doors along on the right, he is sort of in charge".
"Thanks, hope we meet up again." replied Edward before turning and making his way to visit Casper.<p>
